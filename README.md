# Zork Remake

## Description:
Zork Remake is a remake of the classic game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)! It is a text-based adventure game with the classic "Matrix" look of old-school computers with a brand new story and functionality. Implemented with HTML, CSS and most importantly, Javascript, the game allows you to use text commands to walk around, look at the environment and go on an amazing adventure!

I used the base found [here](https://dev.to/shawn2208/building-a-mini-text-based-adventure-game-mini-zork-with-html-css-js-3879) and built on it with a different room layout, items, look, etc.
